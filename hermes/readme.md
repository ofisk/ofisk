OVERVIEW:
    This project is envisioned as a communications system for emergency services.

   - Enable a coordinator to monitor the tree of communication and receive updates on which resources are assigned to which teams
   - Enable the coordinator to make changes to the communication tree through the interface
   - Enable the viewing and management of resources from the application by designated administrators
